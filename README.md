<h1>Automatically download and convert .json for Whatsapp from Webscrap .csv</h1>
Currently it's totally functional despite the rough look
<br>This is a very niche use case but I feel like someone out there might also need it so here it is
<br>
<br>To use this current version follow the following instruction:
<br>You can **download** the Zip, unzip
<br>Or you can **clone** from github via following steps:

```sh
cd "file location" #choose where you can the file to be placed
git clone https://github.com/tufjo/jsonGen
```

<br>Then you'll need to run the following commands in your terminal, these are the components the code needs

```sh
pip install Pillow
pip install pandas
pip install requests
```

Open main.py with a run time software of your choice eg. vscode
<br>run the code and Voila! there you have the thing!
<br> just select a file and click on process & convert and you'll get your stickers ready!
