<h1>Automatically download and convert .json for Whatsapp from Webscrap .csv</h1>
Currently it's totally functional despite the rough look
<br>This is a very niche use case but I feel like someone out there might also need it so here it is

<br>To use this current version follow the following instruction:
<br>Download the Zip, unzip, and open main.py with a run time software of your choice eg. vscode
<br>Inorder for this to work, you'll need to run the following in your terminal

```sh
pip install Pillow
pip install pandas
pip install requests
```

run the code and Voila! there you have the thing!
<br> just select a file and click on process & convert and you'll get your stickers ready!
